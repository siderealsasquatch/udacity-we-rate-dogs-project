# WeRateDogs Udacity Project

This is a draft of my submission for Udacity Data Analyst Nanodegree program. In
this project we were given the task of wrangling data from a selection of
archived tweets from the WeRateDogs twitter account. The data for this project
is contained in the following files:
- `twitter-archive-enhanced.csv`: the archived tweets.
- `image-predictions.tsv`: prediction results from a machine learning algorithm
  trained on a sample of the archived tweets.
- `tweet_json.txt`: the extra data obtained from Twitter.

while cleaned data is contained in the file `twitter-archive-master.csv`

As for the remainder of the files:
- `wrangle_act.ipynb`: details the data wrangling process.
- `wrangle_report.html`: briefly summarizes my experiences wrangling the data
  for this project.
- `act_report.html`: report on the insights that I found in the data.

Additionally, there is an image file `example_tweet.png` for `act_report.html`.

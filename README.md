# WeRateDogs Udacity Project

This is a draft of my submission for Udacity Data Analyst Nanodegree program. In
this project we were given the task of wrangling data from a selection of
archived tweets from the WeRateDogs twitter account. The archived data was
provided to us in the `twitter-archive-enhanced.csv` file. The
`image-predictions.tsv` file containing the predictions of a machine learning
algorithm trained on a sample of the tweets was actually downloaded from a
dedicated repository as part of the project requirements. The `tweet_json.txt`
file contains addtional data that was gathered from Twitter using the Tweepy
library. The `wrangle_act.ipynb` details the steps taken to gather, assess, and
clean the data. Note that this is still a work in progress.
